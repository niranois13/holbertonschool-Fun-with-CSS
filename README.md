# Fun with CSS

This repo is part of __Holberton School__ specialization: __Full Stack__.

<br /><br />

## Repo Overview

In this project, with just __HTML__ and __CSS__, I will implement some _fun_ layouts.
The __HTML__ is provided by my school and I _cannot_ modify it.

<br /><br />

### 1. Sprite

Starting from a large base image (the __sprite__), I have to display it as three separated cards.

### 2. Underline manipulation

I have to add an invisible __underline__ that smoothly appears when the undelined text is hovered.

### 3. Toggle input

I have to change the style of a _checkbox input type_ so it appears __toggled on or off__ based on the check status.

### 4. Hamburger menu

I have to animate a __hamburger menu__ so it _appears on click_ and its elements _react on hover_.
